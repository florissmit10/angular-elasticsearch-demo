A sample recipe search.

## Installing
install docker:
	install docker
	install docker-compose
run the application:
	docker-compose up -d


You'll also need elasticsearch loaded up with recipes and accepting connections on
localhost:9200 for this example.

When all those ducks are in a row, just open index.html in a browser.
